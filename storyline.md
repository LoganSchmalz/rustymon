# Brainstorming
**Story Genre**
- First-person, fictional role-playing game
- "Futuristic" in the sense that some of the technologies are fictional and cannot be explained by modern science
- Zen naturalism/beauty
- Absurdist/surrealist humor in the context of dialogue
- Simple story, try to leave it more open to the user but not fully open world
- Naturalistic but highly exaggerated environment and creatures inspiration from the exaggerated naturalism of media like Annihilation and Life of Pi
- More towards Gen 1 style of pokemon than the more recent, segmented, cutesy style of pokemon

**Character List**
- Main character: *[user-defined name]*, canonically *Augo*, a name that comes from the Latin superlative "Augustus" (sacred, holy, august, majestic, sublime, venerable, solemn)
    - Barebones, want player to be able to feel that the character is similar to them without describing the character too explicitly leave it up to player's imagination to whatever degree that is possible
- Main rival: *Sika*
- Family Members:
    - Parents: Augo's father is the only parent alive still. His mother passed away in a car accident before he was old enough to know her.
- Enemy team: *Team Gamma*

# Story and Dialogue
**Phase One**
- Set in a Greenland-esque biome with an emphasis on the natural world (beautiful, cold, mountainous landscapes), Augo is born in a small homestead, nestled in the valley between two tall mountain scapes. To the North is the town where he grew up, and in the South is a forest which acts as a natural barrier between his home and the rest of the Flardfull region. Augo grew up attached to his home, physical and metaphysical, as deep connections blossomed between him and the forest/mountain spirits. Coming of age, Augo’s calling was brought about by a rift in the spiritual energy he’d come to know so well - a disconnect between the spirits, himself, and his home, so he set about his journey into the forest. Before he sets off into the forest, he and his father part ways. His father gives him his first sprite capture cube, and says that it might come in handy soon.

- The spirits guide him to meet the starter sprites in a forest clearing, three sprites playing together in a sunny, flower-speckled area. As Augo approaches, the user is allowed to make a selection between the different sprites.
Up until this point, the player will not have to encounter any other hostile sprites.
- The player will use the sprite capture cube with a 100% success rate to “catch” the starter that they are drawn most to.
The player makes their way through the forest, guided by the forest spirits. This initial forest run takes a bit of time, and there are going to be several opportunities to return later to explore “locked” places. The player should use this time to naturally level up their starter a bit and collect some items.
- There are several “hints” of The Rift in the forest as the player explores and tries to find the way out. Signs, darkness, etc. I don’t know exactly what this might look like yet but it is supposed to be the beginning of Augo figuring out what is going wrong in the world.
- Outside of the forest, Augo meets a kind gentleman who guides him towards the closest big town (this is exciting!! Augo has never been outside of the forest/valley before).

Dialogue Sequence:

"Welcome to Flardfull! You are about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime, making new friendships with people and fauna all over the region."

"You and your father live together on a homestead in a rural Flardfull valley, surrounded by the Forel Alps with the forest to the South. Since you were young, the mountain and forest spirits guided your adventures in the natural landscapes around your town, and your camaradarie blossomed into a beautiful relationship. One day, though, The Rift appeared, and the spirits set you on a quest to learn what happened."

"When you wake up, it is your time to leave - follow the advice of your elders, make lifelong friends, and learn the secrets of The Rift."

"Now, wake..."

*Cuts to black*

*You appear beside your hammock outside, and are free to move around. You head inside and run into your father.*

"Augo, I hope you rested well. I know what you need to do; this is your time to disembark from your home and learn the secrets of the world."

You hug your father. Big hug.

*You walk outside*

...

*Augo*

...

*Follow us to the forest*

...

Player now walks around and explores the small town, making their way towards the forest. Eventually, walking into the forest triggers the next dialogue sequence.

*When at the forest entrance, some of your spirit friends greet you*

"Augo, you are here!"

"Look, it's Augo"

"Augo, follow us..."

You continue exploring the forest, until you reach a small opening.

"Augo, grab this"

"This is a totem, Augo"

"Use this to capture Strays"

You obtain the totem. You continue walking around the forest, until you reach the clearing containing the three starter Stray.

Sprits:
"Augo, use the totem to capture the Stray - they will acompany you on your journey"

*Player approaches one of the three starter Stray. Confirmation dialogue appears before entering the battle sequence.*
