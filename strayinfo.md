### Description
A rocky bug stray, bitaxa are sometimes indistinguishable from the soil below. They move slow, dragging their bodies against the ground clumsily, occasionally eating small soft critters from the dirt. A bitaxum that lives for long enough will inevitably find plant life attached to it, living through symbyosis with the bitaxum.

### Description
A sleak and smooth stray that glides through water as the webbing on its sides slices through the currents. Pallia appear to float like ghosts through the seas. They are found closer to the surface of the water, and, if one is lucky, one might see a palliub or pack of pallia leap out of the water.

### Description

### Description
An extremely large and vibrant fish stray. Solikigois can frequently be found in rivers, taking up a significant portion of the width of the river, feeding off of the smaller water strays it pushes up in its way. One will commonly find solikigois with damaged dorsal fins, as they tend to be weaker tissue and tend to stick far out of the water, waving in the wind.
