**Bitaxum**: Earth Type
# Description
A rocky bug stray, bitaxa are sometimes indistinguishable from the soil below. They move slow, dragging their bodies against the ground clumsily, occasionally eating small soft critters from the dirt. A bitaxum that lives for long enough will inevitably find plant life attached to it, living through symbyosis with the bitaxum.

**Palliub**: Water Type
# Description
A sleak and smooth stray that glides through water as the webbing on its sides slices through the currents. Pallia appear to float like ghosts through the seas. They are found closer to the surface of the water, and, if one is lucky, one might see a palliub or pack of pallia leap out of the water.

**Rubridum**: Fire Type
# Description
An aggressive flying stray, emboldened by the extended and tough beak the protrudes from its head. The long plumes on its head serve, oftentimes, as a distraction to the other strays. It is uncommon to see more than one rubrida at a time, unless you are lucky enough to find them mating.
