# Type Mecahnics
In Rustymon, there are several different types of creatures; each creature can have one or two types that inform the effectiveness of matching move types when used in battle.
Below is a list of possible types and a matchup-chart to display effectiveness of everything.

*Zen Type*:

"Dervied from the peaceful essense of nature," these creatures employ precise moves utilizing their natural surrounding for effective combat.
Zen movesets are most effective in the context of defensive strategy, weakening the abilities of their opponents before delivering quick, effective blows.

Exclusively Zen-typed creatures are uncommon; instead, Zen will often be paired with other types. 

## Most of the **Elemental** types are offense-focused, and reflect on different foundational aspects of the natural universe.

*Fire Type*:

Fire types are considered to be one of the oldest elemental types, birthed from the supernoval death of stars accross the universe.
Fire movesets are fast and attack focused, able to deliver direct attacks multiple times over to weaken opponents quickly.  

*Water Type*:

Water types are the antithesis to fire types, and bring a more balanced approach to combat. Creatures that are water typed will have the advantage against singly-typed fire creatures, but are generally slower, and err on the defensive more often than fire-types would. They have a varied moveset with lots of opportunity for training your water-type creature to match your style of cambat, be it defensive or offensive. Overall, water types are very well-rounded of the four elemental types. 

*Earth Type*:

Earth types are super-defensive, having the ability to withstand/dilute attacks from a wide-variety of enemy types. They're generally much slower creatures than other types, and when they deliver attacks they will be powerful but hard to land. 

*Wind Type*:

Wind types are extremely weak defensively, but are one of the most technically adept attackers (and fastest movers). Their moveset includes a huge variety of different attack strategies, both physical and specialized. Depending on the environment they are in, they have a chance to be immobilized or greatly weakened or, in rare circumstances, their environment could increase thier speed.

## Other creature types are derived from a variety of aspects that make up our universe.

*Astral/Cosmic Type*:

Astral typed creatures are ancient, and their origins are not well-known. What we do know is that they exist primarily in space, but occasionally settle onto certain planets for extended eras. These creatures are very fast, but generally weak, and their moveset is limited to exclusively special-types.  

*Time Type*:

There are only two known creatures in our universe with this type, and both are exceedingly rare. With the ability to manipulate time through certain moves, they make great support members on a team. On their own, though, they will not fare well against strong, high-HP opponents. 

*Dark and Light Types*:

Dark and Light Types' movesets are completely ineffective against one another, but both have specific characteristics that give them advantages against other types. For example, dark and light types are weak against Earth types, but dark is effective against wind and light is effective against water types.

# Battle Mechanics

Battles in Rustymon can occur between a minimum of two creatures, or can be paired battles (2 v 2). Battles are turn-based and the creature who attacks first is based on a variety of factors (in order of precidence):
