# Type Mecahnics
In Rustymon, there are several different types of creatures; each creature can have one or two types that inform the effectiveness of matching move types when used in battle.
Below is a list of possible types and a matchup-chart to display effectiveness of everything.

*Zen Type*:

"Dervied from the peaceful essense of nature," these creatures employ precise moves utilizing their natural surrounding for effective combat.
Zen movesets are most effective in the context of defensive strategy, weakening the abilities of their opponents before delivering quick, effective blows.

Exclusively Zen-typed creatures are uncommon; instead, Zen will often be paired with other types. 

## Most of the **Elemental** types are offense-focused, and reflect on different foundational aspects of the natural universe.

*Fire Type*:

Fire types are considered to be one of the oldest elemental types, birthed from the supernoval death of stars accross the universe.
Fire movesets are fast and attack focused, able to deliver direct attacks multiple times over to weaken opponents quickly.  

*Water Type*:

Water types are the antithesis to fire types, and bring a more balanced approach to combat. Creatures that are water typed will have the advantage against singly-typed fire creatures, but are generally slower, and err on the defensive more often than fire-types would. They have a varied moveset with lots of opportunity for training your water-type creature to match your style of cambat, be it defensive or offensive. Overall, water types are very well-rounded of the four elemental types. 

*Earth Type*:

Earth types are super-defensive, having the ability to withstand/dilute attacks from a wide-variety of enemy types. They're generally much slower creatures than other types, and when they deliver attacks they will be powerful but hard to land. 

*Wind Type*:

Wind types are extremely weak defensively, but are one of the most technically adept attackers (and fastest movers). Their moveset includes a huge variety of different attack strategies, both physical and specialized. Depending on the environment they are in, they have a chance to be immobilized or greatly weakened or, in rare circumstances, their environment could increase thier speed.

## Other creature types are derived from a variety of aspects that make up our universe.

*Astral/Cosmic Type*:

Astral typed creatures are ancient, and their origins are not well-known. What we do know is that they exist primarily in space, but occasionally settle onto certain planets for extended eras. These creatures are very fast, but generally weak, and their moveset is limited to exclusively special-types.  

*Time Type*:

There are only two known creatures in our universe with this type, and both are exceedingly rare. With the ability to manipulate time through certain moves, they make great support members on a team. On their own, though, they will not fare well against strong, high-HP opponents. 

*Dark and Light Types*:

Dark and Light Types' movesets are completely ineffective against one another, but both have specific characteristics that give them advantages against other types. For example, dark and light types are weak against Earth types, but dark is effective against wind and light is effective against water types.

# Statistic Mecahnics

- Health Points (HP): 
    - Increases with level increase

- Attack: The attack statistic determines foundationally how much damage a certain move does.

- Defense: The defense statistic determines foundationally how much damage other moves do to itself.

- Speed: This statistic determines the first-actor in a battle, but in creature battles this statistic might be shadowed by special moves, abilities, etc. Speed also determines the creature's ability to evade attacks of others.

- Accuracy: This statistic determines the accuracy of a certain move, ie, the chance that it will land a hit on the opposing creature. This statistic is not specific to a single creature, and is instead reset to 100% at the beginning of each battle. Moves themselves will also have an accuracy statistic that alters the chance of a move landing.

- Stat modification that is more controllable than just 'leveling up'
- Put stats on a set curve for level up?

# Battle Mechanics

## Brainstorming

- Earthbound-style turn based
- Some of the types work with eachother (in team battles)
- Consider a 'move-economy' where moves have an associated cost/points and you can only use a certain number per turn
    - Only team battles?
- Consider animation cost, not doing full animations for each stary/move, etc.
---
Party Size: 
- up to 4
- Consider different sprite sizes during battle, 4v4 + GUI might be a lot of information on the screen

Health:
- Battle ends when entire team has 'died'

Turns:
- Turns are based entirely on speed (every stray on the battlefield takes their turn from highest to lowest)
- Should a single faster stray be able to take multiple turns before another slower stray? Some sort of 'limitation' that you can manually control a certain statistic like speed (a plateau of statistic?)

Multi-battles:
- Any size team versus any size team

Moves:
- Each stray has a move set to select from each turn
- Potential problems:
    - Using the same move over and over again : better indication of move's affect over course of battle

Type synergy:
- Need to add which types are 'synergistic,' that is which types provide certain advantages, as well as what those advantages are.


# Interaction Mechanics

- Capturing: The creatures are captured and released via totems, imbued with power from the spirits. Totems are not purchasable, but they can be earned from spirits and sometimes found lying around, forgotten. Totems can be upgraded, either by spirits themselves or those with the blessing of a spirit.
- Encountering: Specific tiles will hide the creatures. Upon walking in them, there is a chance that one will encounter a creature. The kind of creature encountered will depend on the area of the world that the player is in. The player can also call upon the spririts to endow him with an attracting energy that will make creature encounters more common, and possibly occur in tiles that do not hide the creatures.
